        <h1>Summer Knight — Chapters 23 through 34: A Detailed Summary</h1>
        
        <p class="intro">Harry Dresden is running out of time. The Summer Knight, Ronald Reuel, is dead, his mantle of power stolen, and the balance between the Summer and Winter Courts of Faerie is crumbling. If Harry doesn't find the killer and restore the mantle before Midsummer sundown, the White Council will vote to hand him over to the vampires — and the resulting war between the faerie Courts could devastate the mortal world. What follows is the final act of the case, from Harry's desperate investigation to the bloody showdown at the Stone Table.</p>

        <hr>

        <p>Harry drives out to the shore of Lake Michigan in a thunderstorm and summons his faerie godmother, the Leanansidhe. She appears standing casually on the surface of the water, looking gorgeous and slightly smug, as usual. Harry tries to flatter her, and she's pleased — she notes this conversation is much more enjoyable than the last one, where he was dying. Harry needs her help reaching the faerie Queens, Mab and Titania, so he can figure out who killed the Summer Knight.</p>

        <p>Their exchange is classic Harry-and-Lea bickering. Harry accuses her of trying to turn him into a dog. She insists she was protecting him and that he'd have been perfectly happy in a kennel. Harry grudgingly acknowledges that in her own deeply demented way, she does care about him. She also reveals she's been secretly helping him throughout the case — she was the one who created fake police sirens and a fake old-lady voice to scare off threats. Harry didn't even realize it was her.</p>

        <p>Lea can't take Harry directly to the Queens, but she can take him somewhere useful. She offers her hand. Harry is suspicious, since every deal with faeries has burned him before, but she reminds him their bargain prevents her from harming him. He takes her hand. She transports him to "Chicago-Over-Chicago," a spirit-realm copy of the city sculpted from clouds and mist, floating above the real Chicago. This is the battleground the Queens have called into existence for the coming war.</p>

        <p>There, Harry finds the Stone Table — a massive slab of ancient rock covered in glowing runes. Blood spilled on the Table becomes power for whichever Court controls it, and control changes hands at Midsummer and Midwinter. Lea warns Harry never to let Mab bring him here. Using his Sight — the wizard ability to see the true nature of things — Harry witnesses the raw power of Mab and Titania preparing for war. The experience is overwhelming. These are beings whose power rivals archangels, and Harry is an insect by comparison. The vision nearly breaks him, and he collapses, gibbering. He comes to in Lea's lap on the lakeshore.</p>

        <p>From what he saw, Harry deduces that neither Mab nor Titania stole the mantle. Mab isn't pressing an advantage she'd have if she'd done it, and Titania is acting defensively because she doesn't know who did. Both Queens are reacting, not plotting. Lea confirms this reasoning and tells Harry the war begins at sundown. She also tells him he needs to see the Mothers — the most ancient and powerful pair of faerie Queens — but she can't take him to them. Then she kisses his forehead, tells him to consider a haircut because he looks like a dandelion, and dissolves into the lake.</p>

        <p>Harry trudges back to his car. It catches fire when he turns the key. He stands in the rain, staring at his dead engine. His car has died. Again. This is a running gag throughout the series — the Blue Beetle is held together by hope and duct tape, and it picks the worst possible moments to give up.</p>

        <p>Back at his apartment, Harry swallows his pride and calls the White Council for help, reaching the Warden Morgan. Morgan is a zealot who has hated Harry for years, and this call goes about as well as you'd expect. Morgan screams at Harry, calls him a snake, refuses to let him speak to his mentor Ebenezar, and hangs up. Harry destroys the phone by smashing it against the fireplace. He takes a cold shower to calm down, noting with dry humor that he half-expected the water to burst into steam on contact with his skin.</p>

        <p>With the Council useless, Harry has one person left to try. Using a tracking spell built from a stolen tire valve cap, he finds Elaine Mallory — his childhood sweetheart, fellow apprentice of the dark wizard Justin DuMorne, and the woman he thought was dead for over a decade. She's at an airport hotel, eating breakfast, with a plane ticket out of town. She's running.</p>

        <p>Harry sits down uninvited and explains the situation. Elaine is reluctant; she thinks the case is hopeless and wants him to run too. But Harry argues that someone tried to kill both of them, which means they're a threat to whoever did this, which means they actually can stop it. He asks her to help him find the way to the Mothers.</p>

        <p>Elaine resists. She's scared. Harry asks her gently. She calls him an imbecile and a fool — which, in their dynamic, is basically agreement. She makes a call, cancels her plane ticket, and leads him outside. A ghostly carriage pulled by one ice-blue horse and one grass-green horse arrives, invisible to everyone else. Elaine delivers a preemptive "I told you so" before they even climb in, which Harry notes he has now officially seen everything.</p>

        <p>The carriage takes them through mist into the Nevernever, dropping them on a misty moor dotted with twisted trees. A tattered raven leads them forward. Harry almost makes a Poe joke and Elaine threatens to punch him if he says "nevermore." He says "never more" — two words — and she rolls her eyes. It's exactly the kind of bad joke Harry can't resist and Elaine can't abide.</p>

        <p>Their path is blocked by a unicorn, but not the pretty kind. This thing is an armored nightmare — the size of a Budweiser horse, covered in dark green chitin instead of fur, with a three-foot serrated horn, cloven blood-stained hooves, no eyes, and a mane made of rotted cobwebs. It skewers a passing moth and pulverizes the ground around it with sledgehammer stomps. Harry quips that unicorns are very dangerous, and suggests Elaine go first. She is not amused.</p>

        <p>Their plan is for Elaine to lure the unicorn away using pure thoughts (unicorns are attracted to purity), while Harry sneaks past. It nearly works, but the beast turns on Elaine. Harry blasts a trench in the ground with his blasting rod, draws the unicorn's charge, and gets into a terrifying melee involving a tree being impaled clean through, flying splinters, and some creative staff-fighting. Elaine saves him by unleashing a cloud of enchanted memory-motes that overwhelm the unicorn's senses. She holds it in place through sheer concentration while Harry runs ahead.</p>

        <p>He finds the Mothers' cottage — a humble stone hut with a thatch roof, a snowflake carved on the door, and an interior that includes a rocking chair, a loom, and several sets of increasingly horrifying teeth on the mantel. Mother Winter is a bundle of blankets in a rocking chair, whispering. Mother Summer is a brisk old lady who immediately examines Harry like a doctor, tells him to stick out his tongue, and starts sweeping the floor.</p>

        <p>They agree to answer Harry's questions if he answers one of theirs first: what's more important, the body or the soul? Harry says the answer depends on who's asking and when — if you're dying of old age, the soul matters more; if you're about to be burned at the stake, the body does. It's a stupid question, he adds, because the real answer isn't one or the other. The Mothers are pleased. Their question was actually about Aurora, the Summer Lady, who can't see that nuance.</p>

        <p>Through careful questioning, Harry works out the truth. The Summer Knight's mantle passes to the nearest vessel of Summer when the Knight dies. That means one of the Summer Queens redirected it. Titania didn't do it — she started the war because she doesn't know where the mantle went. Mother Summer wouldn't be helping Harry if she were guilty. That leaves Aurora.</p>

        <p>Aurora stole the mantle, poured it into the changeling girl Lily, and turned Lily to stone to trap the power in limbo. This forced both Courts to mobilize around the Stone Table for war. Aurora's plan is to take Lily to the Table after midnight (when it passes to Winter), use a special magical object to free Lily from stone, and then kill her on the Table, permanently transferring the Summer Knight's power to Winter and shattering the balance between the Courts.</p>

        <p>Mother Winter gives Harry the Unraveling — a square of knitted cloth that can undo any enchantment. Harry realizes with a jolt that he could use it to cure his girlfriend Susan, who was half-turned into a vampire. Mother Winter watches him realize this with bone-dry amusement. The Mothers can't interfere directly with the Queens or Ladies. All they can do is give Harry this tool and send him on his way.</p>

        <p>As Harry leaves, he mentions the unicorn guarding the path. Mother Summer looks surprised. Mother Winter's response is chilling: "What unicorn?" She didn't put a guardian there. Someone else did.</p>

        <p>That realization hits Harry like a punch. If the unicorn wasn't the Mothers' creature, then Aurora planted it to monitor who came and went. And if Aurora knows Harry visited the Mothers...</p>

        <p>Before he can process this, the ogre Grum materializes out of thin air and punches him unconscious. Elaine is standing right behind the ogre.</p>

        <p>Harry wakes up inside a ring of toadstools — a faerie prison circle that cuts off his magical senses. He's surrounded by Aurora, Lloyd Slate (the Winter Knight, who's been working for Aurora), Talos (Aurora's Lord Marshal, who had been disguised as the ogre Grum), Korrick (a centaur who was disguised as the nightmare unicorn), and Elaine. Harry's weapons and the Unraveling are gone.</p>

        <p>Aurora tells him she's going to kill him. Harry asks why she hasn't already. Slate says he would have slit Harry's throat immediately. Aurora uses her faerie power to compel Harry to answer questions, gliding past his mental defenses and forcing him to talk. Under her enchantment, Harry lays out the entire case — how Slate killed Reuel, how Aurora redirected the mantle into Lily, how she turned Lily to stone, how she faked Elaine's injury to keep Harry off balance, how she sent her people to kill him.</p>

        <p>Aurora then reveals her motivation, and it's unexpectedly sympathetic. She's not evil — she's idealistic to the point of insanity. She wants to destroy the cycle of Summer and Winter because she sees it as pointless and cruel, with mortals constantly crushed between the two sides. She hates what she's had to do, but she believes it's the only way to end the suffering. Harry tells her that harming mortals in order to help them is insane. Aurora doesn't disagree, but she says it's the only way.</p>

        <p>Slate is eager to kill Harry, but Elaine intervenes. She warns Aurora that if Slate kills Harry while he's inside the circle, Harry will be able to launch a death curse — a wizard's final spell, fueled by their life force, devastating and impossible to block. This is actually true, and Harry had been preparing exactly that. Elaine's intervention appears to be a betrayal, saving Aurora from Harry's last weapon.</p>

        <p>Elaine suggests drowning Harry instead — have Aurora call up water to create quicksand, and Elaine will lock Harry in place with a binding spell. Aurora can leave before Harry dies, putting herself out of death-curse range. Aurora agrees. The ground turns to mud. Harry sinks.</p>

        <p>But as Elaine walks away, she drops a cryptic comment in a flat, casual tone: "It's just like old times." Harry, sinking in mud up to his chest, suddenly gets it. The binding Elaine used is the same one she used when they were teenagers, and Harry knows how to break it because he's the one who originally designed the spell. They used to split their homework — one would create the spell while the other did the schoolwork, then they'd copy each other's answers and go to bed together. The binding was Harry's sloppy teenage work: effective but brittle, with a weak point at the small of the back like a Christmas bow.</p>

        <p>Elaine didn't betray him. She saved his life twice — once by preventing Aurora from being in death-curse range, and once by using the one binding spell she knew Harry could escape. Harry mutters that if it works, he'll buy her a pony.</p>

        <p>He waits, fully submerged in warm mud, counting heartbeats. Between heartbeat seventy-four and seventy-five, Aurora's circle drops. Harry reaches for power, finds the clumsy center of the binding, and cracks it. Then he's merely drowning in quicksand. He blasts himself free with a force spell, launches out of the mud like a rocket, and crash-lands twenty feet up in a dead tree, dangling from his belt.</p>

        <p>The Gatekeeper — a mysterious member of the Senior Council who's been quietly helping Harry — finds him hanging in the tree and has to stifle laughter. Harry's boots fall off. It's deeply undignified. The Gatekeeper offers Harry an out: he's done enough to satisfy Mab's bargain and save himself from the Council's vote. He can go home.</p>

        <p>Harry considers it. He's exhausted, mud-covered, and half-dead. But he thinks of Meryl, the changeling girl who hired him; of Lily, turned to stone; of Elaine, fighting from the inside. He can't walk away. He says the reason is simple: "Because I'm an idiot. And there are people in trouble."</p>

        <p>The Gatekeeper tells Harry that if he'd walked away, the Gatekeeper would have killed him personally rather than hiding behind a Council vote. It's a statement of harsh respect. He gives Harry two gifts: an ointment that lets you see through faerie glamours (easier on the nerves than using the Sight), and a chip of the Stone Table on a thread that will point toward the Table like a compass. Then he opens a portal straight to Harry's apartment.</p>

        <p>Harry goes home, showers off the Nevernever mud, and gets dressed. All in black. His leather duster, a gift from Susan, with its dramatic billow. He loads his sports bag with every weapon and magical tool he owns. He calls Billy and the werewolves — the Alphas, a pack of college-age shapeshifters. He also picks up a doctor's valise and leaves it by his front door. Its contents will matter later.</p>

        <p>Billy arrives in a minivan packed with volunteers. Every single Alpha came. So did the changelings Meryl and Fix. Harry smears the Gatekeeper's ointment under everyone's eyes — anti-glamour war paint — and they head for the waterfront, following the compass stone.</p>

        <p>At the docks, they're ambushed. The changeling Ace, who hired the ghoul assassin called the Tigress to kill Harry, is waiting with a rifle. He shoots Meryl in the leg. The Tigress attacks in her true form — a hideous cross between a human, a hyena, and a baboon. The werewolves take her apart with brutal efficiency, and Harry forces himself to look away from what's left. Meryl kicks Ace until he confesses that the Red Court vampires put him up to it. Meryl lets him go with contempt.</p>

        <p>The compass stone leads them to the end of a pier, where Harry's magic reveals a staircase made of congealed starlight climbing into the storm. It's the path to Chicago-Over-Chicago and the Stone Table. Harry complains, between panting breaths, that they couldn't have made it an escalator. They climb about a mile of stairs.</p>

        <p>The battlefield above is chaos. The clouds have been shaped into terrain, and thousands of faerie creatures are fighting — ogres in armor, goblins dragging their dead, sylphs eating carrion, giant bumblebees the size of park benches. The noise is overwhelming: trumpets, drums, screams, bellows, and thunder. Harry fights off a swarm of the giant bees with his blasting rod, incinerating one's wings in midair. Fix stares and mouths "Wow." Harry nearly tears his hair out — they need to keep moving, not gawk.</p>

        <p>Harry finds Mab on a hilltop, mounted on a white horse, radiating cold beauty and power so intense that the werewolves and changelings can barely function in her presence. Harry reports that Aurora is the thief. Mab understands instantly. She directs Harry to the river, which will lead him through the battle to the Stone Table. Her forces know Harry and won't attack him. Winter holds the river, thanks to Harry's godmother and Maeve.</p>

        <p>They push through the carnage toward the river. The sights are nightmarish. Harry tries to shield Fix and Meryl from the worst of it. He calls encouragement to the werewolves even though he has no idea if they can hear him over the din, because it seems like the right thing to do since he dragged them there.</p>

        <p>At the river, they run into Aurora's forces. Lloyd Slate, the Winter Knight fighting for Summer's side, comes leaping across the river on a faerie steed, laughing and splattered in multicolored blood. Aurora arrives with Talos, Korrick the centaur carrying Lily's statue strapped to his back, and a score of Sidhe warriors. Aurora silences the battlefield with a gesture and orders everyone killed.</p>

        <p>Harry's battle cry as the Sidhe cavalry charges is, absurdly and perfectly: "I don't believe in faeries!"</p>

        <p>The fight is desperate. Harry trips the charging horses with a low force-shield, a clever trick — the faerie riders warded against spells aimed at them, but their horses didn't. Talos rolls clear and attacks with supernatural grace. Meryl intercepts him, catching his sword in an X of her axe and machete, and headbutts him in the face hard enough to stagger a faerie lord. But she doesn't see Slate lunge from the side. The Winter Knight drives his frost-covered sword through her body. Fix screams her name.</p>

        <p>Harry channels lightning from the storm through his staff and blasts Slate with it. The bolt sends the Winter Knight flying but barely staggers Talos, whose magic-resistant armor shrugs off everything Harry throws. When Talos disarms him of both staff and blasting rod, Harry resorts to the decidedly un-wizardly tactic of pulling his .357 Magnum and shooting him point-blank. The bullet doesn't penetrate the faerie mail but hits Talos like a sledgehammer. Harry then pistol-whips him unconscious and kicks him in the face for good measure. He acknowledges it was cheap, but he's in a war and he's angry.</p>

        <p>Fix, the tiny changeling with the toolbox, attacks Slate with a giant monkey wrench, breaking the Winter Knight's wrist, smashing his kneecap, and beating him into the ground while screaming, "You hurt Meryl!" Fix, who has been meek and nervous throughout the entire book, turns out to be ferocious when someone he cares about is in danger.</p>

        <p>Maeve, the Winter Lady, arrives with cavalry from the river and mops up the remaining Summer warriors. She flashes Harry a girlish smile, licks blood off her sword, and tells him his godmother sends her greetings. She would have helped sooner, she says, but that would have made it a fair fight, and she avoids those.</p>

        <p>Harry, the werewolves, Fix, and the badly wounded Meryl push upstream toward the Stone Table. Harry can see Aurora at the top of the hill, working on the Unraveling. He uses a wind spell to snatch the cloth from her hands, sticks his tongue out at her, yells "Meep, meep!" and runs. It's the kind of move that would be suicidally disrespectful to a Faerie Queen, and Harry does it on pure adrenaline and defiance.</p>

        <p>Aurora recovers the Unraveling, pins Harry to the ground with wind, and raises a wall of poisonous thorns around the hilltop. If a single thorn scratches you, you're paralyzed. Two or three will kill you.</p>

        <p>A Sidhe rider drives a spear at Harry's throat — but it's Elaine. She's been disguised in faerie armor. She removes the wind spell holding him down and tells him they need to get out. Harry refuses. He needs through those thorns.</p>

        <p>Elaine argues that the thorns are poisonous, won't burn, and can't be forced aside permanently. If Harry tries to push through, Aurora will sense it and tear him apart while he's concentrating. Harry asks Elaine to hold the thorns back with wind while he runs through. She hesitates. She's been serving Aurora under a life-debt and has already betrayed her once.</p>

        <p>Harry pushes her. He says he wants to believe that what they had as kids meant something, that he can trust her with his life. Elaine tells him he doesn't know what she is anymore. But she believes he can be trusted. She agrees to help.</p>

        <p>Elaine channels wind into the thorns, forcing them apart, and Harry sprints through. One thorn catches his leather jacket but doesn't break skin. He bursts through to the hilltop just as Aurora uses the Unraveling to free Lily from stone. Green hair flows back from marble. Lily opens her eyes. Aurora seizes her by the throat and drags her toward the Table, knife drawn.</p>

        <p>Harry slugs the Summer Lady in the back with a two-handed staff swing. It's not gentlemanly, but it knocks the knife away. Lily rolls free. At that exact moment, midnight strikes — the stars align, the runes on the Table shift from gold to cold blue, and the Table passes to Winter.</p>

        <p>Aurora kicks Harry across the hilltop and hurls fire at him. Talos crash-lands inside the thorns (his horse didn't make it over — it screams horribly as it falls on the poisoned thorns) and comes at Harry with his sword, disarming him of his staff. Then something massive tears through the thorn wall.</p>

        <p>It's Meryl. She has Chosen — embraced her troll heritage — and transformed into a huge, green, hideous troll wielding an axe. She's covered in poisoned wounds and bleeding dark-green ichor. She's dying. But she grabs Talos and drags him down, crushing him beneath her weight with a gurgling cry of rage and triumph.</p>

        <p>Harry reaches the sacrificial knife before Aurora can, and throws it away. Aurora says she'll tear out Lily's throat with her bare hands. Harry opens the doctor's valise and says he knows something Aurora doesn't: the phone number to Pizza Spress.</p>

        <p>Toot-toot, a six-inch pixie who commands a small army of faerie sprites loyal to Harry because he pays them in pizza, rockets out of the bag wearing makeshift armor and blowing a tiny trumpet. He shrieks, "In the name of the Pizza Lord! Charge!" Behind him erupts a cloud of pixies, all armed with orange plastic box knives from Wal-Mart — handles made of plastic, but the blades are cold steel, which is lethal to faeries.</p>

        <p>Aurora laughs — until the first box knife slashes her hand and draws blood. Her golden power flickers. The pixies swarm her from every direction, their steel blades shearing through her fine faerie mail like cardboard. It's not pretty. Dozens of cuts in seconds. Aurora realizes with horror what's happening: the tiny, insignificant creatures Harry has been feeding pizza to all series long are the weapon that brings down a Faerie Queen.</p>

        <p>Aurora, bleeding and dying, crawls toward the Table. If she bleeds to death on it, she accomplishes her goal — her life force and power would pour into Winter and destroy the balance. Harry tackles her and bears her to the ground, rolling them both away from the Table.</p>

        <p>Aurora dies in Harry's arms. In her final moments, she doesn't look like a mad faerie sorceress. She looks like a frightened girl. She whispers that she just wanted the hurting to stop. Harry smooths the blood from her hair and tells her that the only people who never hurt are dead. She says she doesn't understand. He says he doesn't either. A tear rolls down her cheek, mixing with the blood, and then she's gone.</p>

        <p>It's over. Harry saved Lily, stopped the thief, proved Mab's innocence, and earned Winter's support for the White Council, saving his own life in the process. He lies next to Aurora's body, too exhausted to move.</p>

        <p>The Queens — Mab and Titania — find him there. Titania's golden light gathers Aurora's body and carries it away. Mab tells Harry she is well pleased. Harry tells her to go away. She offers him a deal: become the new Winter Knight and all debts between them are canceled. Harry's answer: "Not just no. Hell, no." Mab smiles and says she'll offer again — just twice more, and he'll be free of her.</p>

        <p>Lloyd Slate, captured and broken, begs Harry to take the Knight's mantle instead of leaving him to whatever Mab has planned. His screams linger after the faeries leave.</p>

        <p>Harry wakes up in his apartment. Billy tells him that Meryl died but wanted Harry to know she made her Choice and didn't regret it. The Alphas earned a collective 155 stitches but all survived. Harry's mentor Ebenezar has smoothed things over with the Council for now.</p>

        <p>Harry takes a shower and discovers that his entire apartment has been cleaned. Furniture polished, rugs aired, icebox stocked with fresh food, ice cream in the freezer, even a new wooden litterbox for his cat Mister. Harry stares around and says, "I died. I died and someone made a clerical error and this is heaven."</p>

        <p>Fix and Lily come to visit. Lily is the new Summer Lady — when Aurora died, her power flowed into the nearest Summer vessel, which happened to be Lily since she was holding the Knight's mantle. Her hair has turned snow white. She chose Fix as her new Summer Knight. Harry notes that Fix already kicked the Winter Knight's ass once, which makes Fix blush and literally drag one foot on the ground. Lily had brownies — the faerie kind, not the chocolate kind — clean Harry's apartment, and Fix fixed Harry's car. Harry has to blink back tears.</p>

        <p>That evening, Elaine shows up in a Cubs hat and jean shorts. She apologizes for how things went. Harry accepts it — Aurora thought she was doing something good, and he can see how Elaine got drawn in. Elaine notices the photos of Susan on Harry's mantel, the letters, the engagement ring. She tells Harry to stop feeling sorry for himself. He was living in a sewer, destroying himself with guilt. Whatever happened with Susan, he won't help her by turning into a living mildew collection. Harry notes the irony of getting romantic advice from his ex. She kisses his cheek and leaves. He never reports her to the Council.</p>

        <p>Harry goes to Billy's apartment for a pizza party and tabletop role-playing game night. The werewolves are bruised, stitched, and happy. Harry asks for a barbarian character sheet with big bulging thews, because he doesn't want to think too much. Billy says the only disappointment is that through all the faeries and mad queens, nobody quoted Shakespeare.</p>

        <p>Harry laughs, settles in with friends, pizza, Coke, and dice, and pretends to be Thorg the Barbarian. It hurts, but it's an honest, healing kind of pain. And the last line of the book is the Shakespeare quote nobody managed to work in during the actual adventure:</p>

        <p><em>Lord, what fools these mortals be.</em></p>
